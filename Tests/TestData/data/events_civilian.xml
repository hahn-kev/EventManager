<event name="KESTREL_UNLOCK" unique="true">
	<text>As is customary in Union space, several corporate advertisements from the planet nearby play over your radio. You listen to them idly as you browse the nearby shipyards, gazing at various antique vessels. One in particular catches your eye, a Kestrel in seemingly full working order! You don't get to look at it very long though, when one of the advertisements catches your ear. It seems one from "Dewey Alms", CEO of Archive Incorporated, has an outgoing request for any capable mercenary vessel.</text>

	<text>It seems these shipyards are in fact owned by Archive, so it's not difficult to get in touch with a correspondant who patches you in to Dewey directly. "Renegades? I have experience with your types. Before we begin, I would like to make it clear that, while I might be the CEO of Archive Inc., in this request I am not speaking on behalf of the company in any way. It would be... bad PR to get involved with more inter-dimensional renegades after the disaster of the 'Rusting Hulks' incident. I'm sure you understand."</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>We do.</text>
		<event>
			<text>"Good, good. Heh, don't worry. We aren't skirting the Union's laws or anything with this. I just don't want any backlash from a personal affair. As you may or may not already know, Archive specializes in the... well, archival of Antiquum Terrae (or as you might know it, Old Earth) technology and culture. This matter concerns one of my most prized antiques, a 23rd century 'Kasparov,' the first FTL-capable ship produced by humankind. Originally made to transport passengers to and from Tau Ceti. A remarkable achievement... but she has been stolen by pirates! I can't gather why... sure she marks a new age in exploration and discovery, but why would a pirate want such an oudated piece of technology?"</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>To sell it?</text>
				<event>
					<text>"But to who? Plenty of Kasparov's were made. This particular model would be of no interest to anyone but an avid historian or ship enthusiast like me. Never the matter. My request; hunt down those thieves and secure the Kasparov. I haven't in mind any particular reward, but I'm sure we can work something out. Name your price."</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>What about that old Kestrel?</text>
						<event>
							<text>"Huh? That old thing? Oh, I can most certainly part ways with it. I jumped on purchasing one when they saw a sudden resurgence in popularity at the end of the Civil War, but now it seems everyone has one. Good deal then. One last thing - I've programmed the coordinates for the pirate ship into my assistant, Gana. He's just a machine, and not a very personable one at that, but he'll be sufficiently useful in combat. I would advise keeping him around, or else you might not be able to find the Kasparov. Best of luck captain. Godspeed!"</text>

	<text>"My fellow citizens of the Galactic Union, subsidiary of the United Federation and regulator of laws in Union territory, I have come to speak with you about a very important matter. Since the dawn of civilization we have been creatures bound to our weapons of war. Every race, Human, Zoltan, Aquarian, Rockman, Mantis, even Engi or Orchid, we have all waged wars not just against each other, but ourselves. It is beyond many of us, unthinkable even, to surrender these tools of destruction... nay, these evil and wicked thoughts that plague our civilizations. We say we wish to evolve, learn and grow, but how can we do this when we still hold so dear to us the ideas of revenge and hatred?"</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Continue...</text>
		<event>
			<text>"To emphasize my point, let me tell you all a story. Back during the infamous Mantis - Human war, a time when the seeds of thought that would grow to be the Federation had only just barely been planted, the Human people were in dire straits. The far more dangerous and warrior-like creatures that were the Mantis caused havoc among the unprepared human colonies. The Humans turned to the only allies they had at the time, the Engi, hoping for assistance. The Engi reluctantly accepted, but only in turn if the humans would liberate the slaves from the Mantis war camps. The two forces fought for years and years for control over the neighbouring planet Mars, which the Mantis had managed to secure as a stronghold and key point for planning their invasion. Rather than negotiating for a ceasefire, or surrendering, the human people continued to fight the Mantis to near extinction. The Mantis would show the humans no mercy either, and would not stop until humanity had been eradicated."</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Continue...</text>
				<event>
					<text>Bolin clears his thought, and flips through a few pages, confused. "The uh... The Mantis are not the only violent race known to have staged such terrible wars. The Rock Inquisitions are perhaps some of the worst battles known to the galaxy. Believing themselves to be superior, the Rockmen sent forth battalions of armored ships staffed by trained soldiers known as the Crusaders to claim other territory in the name of the holy Rock Theocracy. The Chrysolic Faith that drove the Rockmen to such violence was the very same used by the Rock Elders to enslave their population through tactics of fear. Clearly an immoral action, it is known to many that the Rock dictatorship is perhaps one of the most violent and unforgiving forces in the galaxy."</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>Continue...</text>
						<event>
							<text>"The religious persecution of the Rockmen government is not the only example of uh... of barbarianism leading to unjust treatment of other races. Going back to the Mantis, the Mantis race has for many years enslaved the Engi race for usage of their excellency at repairs. The Mantis race, due to their anatomy, are often incapable of performing precise work with electronics, though their claws have been known to function in place of screwdrivers or other tools from time to time. It is interesting to compare the differences between the two functionally opposite races. Similar duality is not often seen, though some have commented on the benefits of mixing Orchid and Rockmen crew together, due to the fire-proof nature of the Rockmen because of their hard, though not actually rock, exterior."</text>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>Continue...</text>
								<event>
									<text>"However, it also stands to say that the Orchids may actually function better with the Shells, who's reliance on oxygen naturally would pair them with the plant beings. It is a scientific wonder how a single Orchid is capable of effectively replacing a life support system for extended periods of time. Many biologists, many of which coincidentally also happen to be Shells, have attempted to study Orchid biology. For those of you who might not be aware, the Shell race has placed a heavy focus on scientific study, even occasionally abducting tourists or visiting ships to run quick, albeit painless, tests. This has led to many cultural misunderstandings with the less understanding species, such as the Rockmen or Mantis. The Slugs also have a particular interest in the Shells, though not for any innocent reasons. A clan of Slug hobbyists known as the Exotic Hunters Guild has formed, whose specific purpose is to hunt rare or sapient creatures. The Shells are their prime targets, because of their armored abilities."</text>
									<choice hidden="true">
										<text>Continue...</text>
										<event>
											<text>"Frighteningly, the attacks lead by the EHG, that being the aforementioned Exotic Hunters Guild for any of those not paying attention, are near synonymous with the earlier but still relatively recent series of conflicts known as the Slug Expansion Wars. I'm sure many of you here are already aware of the history of the Slug Expansion Wars, but I will share a brief summary of the conflicts for those of you who aren't."</text>

													<text>Bolin licks the page and flips to the next. He coughs slightly, pounds on his chest, and continues to read. "Starting after the Rebellion's rise to power, the Federation forces were dedicated to clearing out Rebel ships from their territory. This left much of space unprotected from invaders. The Slugs, who had previously been shunned from the Federation for their traitorous nature, took notice to this pattern and began planning a mass migration to new territory. Though they started with nebulous sectors, they soon found themselves courageous enough to attack clear sectors, sometimes even already occupied space. This came to cause issues when the Slugs dared invade Mantis and Rock space, much to the reasonable displeasure of those governments. Both the Hive and Elders declared war on the Slugs, and so they fought for several years. Eventually, the Slugs surrendered and offered back territory. They didn't stop there however, and even offered some of their original territory up as well. This eventually evolved into an alliance that we have come to know as the Coalition."</text>
													<choice hidden="true">
														<text>Continue...</text>
														<event>
															<text>"This lack of Federation protection over Union space also led to the rise of the Militia. However, I will spare you all this tale, as I know everyone here is for certain familiar with the story."</text>
															<choice hidden="true">
																<text>Oh thank god.</text>
																<event>
																	<text>"I WILL however tell the story of the Coalition, in case you might not be aware. The Coalition is a truce between the Sethnian Kleptocracy, the Urtharean Theocracy, the Yeitiiik Hive, and the Eargen Kraterocracy... oh my notes aren't really sure what the Leech government is called. Seems it's actually the Eargen Republic, but that's not relevant to the history. These 4 races are perhaps some of the most hostile and deadly in the galaxy, and this alliance has caused fear for both the Federation and Rebellion. The Coalition continues to grow in power, and even occupies several of its own sectors. The Coalition has also taken usage of Slug Cealaforming tech, a method of transporting nebulous gases to create artificial nebulas.
