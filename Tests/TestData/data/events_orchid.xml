You're befuddled by what they mean until you realise they're referring to a small plant sample you brought with you. You give over the sapling and in return they give you a brand new Kernel weapon!</text>
	<text>As you jump in to this beacon, a nearby Orchid vessel quite literally explodes, for seemingly no reason too! Despite the confusion, it appears a Kernel weapon survived.</text>

Unfortunately, as a Federation-hired renegade, you fall under this category.</text>
	<text>The blood red hull of a seemingly Orchid vessel glides by, but this is no friend of yours. These are Vampweeds, a subspecies of Orchids so aggressive they were forced out of the Gathering by the usually peaceful Florals. Such aggression can be observed when they suddenly attack you for no reason!</text>

On this planet we grow and manufacture our best weapons and ships. Now pirates hold it hostage! We just barely escaped with our lives, but we must get back and save our people? Will you aid us?"</text>
