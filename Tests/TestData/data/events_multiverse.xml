	<text>"You know what, I'm done fighting you. This is all so pointless." Leah waits for a moment. "Haha, psych! You should have seen the look on your face! HAHA! Now I'm going to kick your ass for REAL this time! Just you wait, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"I still haven't forgotten our showdown at Prospect 17! Real smooth use of that industrial Mining Beam! You might have amputated my left index finger, but now I'm going to amputate your face! Beyatch!"</text>

	<text>You wait for the ship's captain to speak, but you only pick up a hoarse cough. "S-sorry, my throat hurts from all the yelling. I have to whisper. I'm still going to get you this time, BEYATCH! Ouch, that hurt..."</text>
	<text>Right in front of you teleports Leah, just as confused as you are. "Huh? Oh, sorry, wrong ship. Just ignore this." Leah beams away back to her own ship, where she hails you again. "Die, beyatch!"</text>

	<text>"Yo, what's up! You won't believe what I've been up to! I wrote a diss track! And it's about YOU! It goes somethin' like this..." You wait, but no rapping comes. "Okay, sooo I forgot the lyrics. So let's just skip that, and get to the killing, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"BOO! Haha, scared you, didn't I?! That trick always works back at camp. I can tell because those cowards try and pretend they weren't scared, just like you're doing now! Whatever, now it's ass-kicking time, beyatch!"</text>

How does it feel to be such a pain in the ass, people hate you more than DUSKBRINGERS?! Hah, must suck to suck beyatch!"</text>
	<text>You wait for the ship to make any sort of movement, but there's nothing. Suddenly, Leah startles awake. "Uh, you didn't see me sleeping, right? Oh thank god, it would be so embarrasing if you caught me asleep at my post. Wait a minute... I should be fighting you, beyatch!"</text>
	<text>"I'm getting sick and tired of seeing you everywhere I go! It's like you're following me... creep! That's what you are, some freak obsessed with me because I'm so amazing. Well I don't think highly of stalkers, beyatch!"</text>

<textList name="TEXT_ENCOUNTER_MV_REBEL">
	<text>It appears you aren't alone! A fellow Multiverse Traveler, this time a Rebel, has already found their way to this beacon, and is moving in on your location.</text>
	<text>You were aware the Rebels had been finding their way into this sector, but you didn't expect to see a Multiverse-drive equipped vessel defending this beacon!</text>
	<text>It appears you aren't the only ship at this beacon, nor the only ship with a Multiverse-Drive here either! A hostile Multiverse Rebel ship has spotted you and is moving in to attack.</text>
	<text>"Haha! At last we have found you. It only took 768 different realities full of chocolate pudding or shape-shifting god aliens to find you here!" A beat up Multiverse Rebel ship moves in, weapons armed and ready.</text>
	<text>A confident Rebel captain of the nearby Multiverse ship boasts about his abilities at tracking you down, and swiftly gives his crew orders to attack. You figure you should do the same.</text>
	<text>The Rebel ship at this beacon looks like it has been through a lot... and for good reason! It's a Multiverse Traveler, and it seems they've tracked you down to this beacon and are looking for a fight.</text>
	<text>The Rebels are a common sight all around the galaxy, but the ship here is no ordinary Rebel. They appear to be a Multiverse-Drive equipped vessel, and they've decided to engage you in combat!</text>
	<!--new batch! 3.11-->
	<text>"You're that Universe 0 bloke! Haha, we've got you now. You're one hard fellow to track down, but in the end, the Rebellion will always win!"</text>
	<text>A Rebel Multiverse ship approaches. "You son of a buzzard, do you know how many realities we had to suffer through until we found you? This is like, the 9th version of myself to pilot the 16th version of this ship! So quit running and just die!"</text>
	<text>You're amazed at the amounts of effort these Rebels go to tracking you down. A Rebel ship in poor condition bears down on you, determined not to let you past.</text>
	<!--new batch! 4.0-->
	<text>A mute Rebel officers fumbles, performing lazy sign language your translator slowly converts to verbal communication. "A Free Mantis ripped out my tongue. I blame you. Now I'm going to kill you."</text>
	<text>You receive a hail from an overweight Rebel. "I was an MFK Ace you know, but then I took a Bio-Beam to the knee. But if I can kill you... maybe Vance will give me another chance!" You suspect he's lying, but you don't have time to refute his claim.</text>
	<!--new batch! 4.10.3-->
	<text>The pastel blue hull of a Rebel MV Traveler glides past. As soon as they spot you, they power up their weapons and engage!</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship comes screaming into the system... Literally. The captain is shouting at the top of his lungs. Some of these Rebels are complete nuts. Look like you'll have to crack another one.</text>
	<text>"Straight out of Universe 1, and the first thing I find is a Federation Multiverse Traveler? My luck is never this good! Promotion, here I come..." Seems you'll have to prove this isn't quite the lucky encounter he's looking forward to.</text>
	<text>A Rebel captain appears on the vidscreen, chewing on a squirming bowl of young Orchids. "While tracking you down, we ran out of food. Now I'm stuck eating these gross baby things. Please, just let me kill you, so I can go find some food that doesn't cry when I bite it."</text>
	<text>A nearby Multiverse travelling Rebel ship broadcasts an automated message; "Glory to the Rebellion!" You remember the time when the Rebels cared enough to actually say it themselves. At least, you get to blow them up all the same.</text>

	<text>"Ah shit, guess I'm dead now." The Multiverse Traveler's vessel promptly shuts down.</text>
	<text>You've sent another crew of Multiverse Travelers to the great multiverse in the sky. You hope this doesn't end up being you someday down the line instead.</text>
	<text>The Multiverse Traveler has met his untimely end. That'll teach the galaxy not to mess with the likes of you.</text>

	<text>The defeat of this vessel marks another victory for you and your crew. You hold a celebratory toast in hopes to more successful battles after salvaging the wreck.</text>

	<text>Some day, you might earn enough of a name for yourself that these ships stop trying to mess with you. But for now, you can cross another set of pillagers off the list.</text>

	<text>"Ok, we messed up. But if you kill us, well that's just not very cool man."</text>
	<text>"Look, this was a bit of a mistake. Let us go, and we promise we'll never make this mistake again. Probably."</text>

	<text>The ship hails you, their captain soliciting a... favor for your 'pleasure' in turn for letting them live. When you express your disinterest, they offer something of more monetary value instead.</text>
	<text>The enemy hails you, speaking a mess of untranslated garble. "Apologies, I forgot to turn my translator on again." The captain pauses. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAH DON'T KILL US DON'T KILL US!"</text>
	<text>"Do you know who I am? If you kill me, my 37 wives will be absolutely devastated! Please spare me, for their sake! But also mostly mine!"</text>
	<text>"I have traveled thousands of realities and no ship has ever fared so well against me as you. You have earned the right to not be killed by me. Please stop." The enemy captain sounds triumphant, but you can see the fear in his eyes.</text>
	<text>"God, this is worse than the time we had to fight off an infestation of parasitic bat-worms! I can't believe I'm saying this, but we surrender!"</text>
	<text>"We will not surrender! Okay that's a lie, we surrender. I really don't want to die."</text>
	<text>"Ugh, I can't believe I've been brought to my knees by such an ugly bastard like you. Will you take our surrender, so my legend doesn't have to end in such a disappointing manner?"</text>
	<text>"I'm too pretty to die! Wait, maybe I can buy this stupid idiot off with some junk... wait, is my mic on?" The ship goes silent, followed by an offer of surrender.</text>
	<text>"Great, another scar for my face. I'd like to live past today, even if it means I'm going to be the mutilated amputee that you've left me as. Can I buy your mercy perhaps?"</text>
