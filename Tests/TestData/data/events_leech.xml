	<text>With the ship out of the way, you turn your attention back to the strange Leech ship, but see it has slinked away from the combat. It's heavily damaged, and the interior view shows wounded soldiers and one heavily armored Leech wiping blood off of his teeth using his tail.</text>

			<text>"So, you've come to kill us? Another one of Tyrdeo's pawns. Do what you may, but know that the Republic will fall. I have put into motion things you cannot undo by simply killing me. Cut off a Leech's head, and it'll only grow back stronger!"</text>

					<text>The Leech pauses, and his two eye slits squint tighter than normal. "You look too high standing to be an agent of that purple parasite. My introduction is irrelevant, so I will spare you the details. I am Alkram Tripae, former general of the Eargen Republic under leadership of President Oertiss during the Federation-Mantis War. Now, in my old age, I have taken to ensuring the stability of the crown by ridding it of its current incompetency."</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>Crown? I though Tyrdeo was president.</text>
						<event>
							<text>"Exactly my point. That exuberant, dimwitted moron carries with him a shiny golden crown and fancies himself king, yet he has done nothing but lead our kind into even greater turmoil. If you do not fight for Tyrdeo, and are most certainly not of the Rebellion, then I figure you must be Federation in some respect. This skirmish is only a minor one - soon, we will reconvene at Tyrdeo's mansion where he is hiding, and seize the Republic. If you stand for the same liberties as the Federation claims then I hope you will join us." Alkram transfers over some coordinates and immediately goes back to focusing on his crew.</text>

You sling him over your shoulder and haul him over to Alkram, who has arrived at the palace as well and thanks you. "We found a cruiser in one of the hangars, seems to have been Tyrdeo's private cruiser and his escape plan. He has no use for it anymore, so we'll give it to the Federation as a gift."</text>

									<text>Tyrdeo is dragged out to the courtyard where you see most of the fighting has already stopped. Seeing the president captured, the last of the loyalists surrender. Tyrdeo is strung up in front of the crowd of jeering Leeches as he continues to sob. Even some of the Coalition and Inquisition officers join in. Tyrdeo pleads, "Heavens, is this really necessary? You were the ones that put me in charge, I only tried to help!" Tyrdeo lets out a giant sob. "I know it was stupid to give the Vampweeds flowers, but I was only trying to make friends! Joining the Coalition seemed the best way to stabilize the nation! What was I to do? I was a landscaper before this! And a bad one! Why did you put me in charge?!"</text>

I faced down Engi war machines and Zoltan peacekeepers in that war, while you were busy trimming hedges! You had your chance, but it's time the Eargen Republic had a competent leader for once!" The crowd joins in, chanting and practically drooling at the mouth for the prospect of killing the former President. In one final effort, Tyrdeo turns to you, pleading. "Please, I know I made mistakes, I know the Coalition is your enemy, but you can't let them do this! I don't want to be president anymore, I never did! I just want to live!"</text>

Alkram begins to make a speech, "For too long the Republic has been stifled by incompetency. It's time a TRUE leader takes the crown, and I could think of no one better than mysel-" Alkram is cut off by the crowd, who begins to boo again. Seems the Leeches have finally caught onto their situation. Cycles and cycles of the same thing over and over, and they're done with it. Alkram backs down, terrified that he's about to meet the same fate.</text>

At least the Republic might finally see better days. Are you in need of a fighter? I have gotten older, but I'm still more than competent."</text>

You're just another corrupt, power hungry wannabe trying to seize power through force!" cries one angry bystander, and the rest agree. Soon the mob has swarmed Alkram and things turn bloody. In the chaos, Tyrdeo breaks free and rushes over to you. "I might faint. I haven't been this terrified in all my life. I've soiled myself! Oh wait, sorry, you didn't need to know that. Anyways - please, take me with you! I can do more than trim hedges, I promise!" You agree, but before you can make it back to the ship, Tyrdeo ducks back into his palace and returns with his bird which he loads into the cargo. What a strange, strange man.</text>
