	<text>There are many ways to describe the Duskbringers. One such way might be overly agressive space nazis, but you don't have time to fathom more before a ship is attacking!</text>
	<text>A Duskbringer ship is approaching at high speeds. Arm the weapons!</text>
	<text>Duskbringer patrols often scout out the sector to ward off unwanted visitors. One of these patrols has spotted you and moves in to attack.</text>

	<text>Despite trying desperately to keep pirate forces at bay, there's a considerable amount of underground black markets and slave trades held in Duskbringer sectors.

As you have surely noticed, the Rebels are quite the issue for us since Vance ordered them to betray our pact. Now, my men and I have been assigned to keeping this... filth out of our sector. There is a particularly slippery and obnoxious Rebel commander around these parts who has been giving me trouble. Give me your service and kill him, and I will give you mine in return.

					<text>Alban laughs for a straight minute, until he realizes you aren't joking. "You're serious? How incredibly stupid! Though... we could use help. We've managed to secure control of the Dusk's command tower and by extension the shield generator for this place, but we haven't been able to do considerable damage yet. Our fleet has been stopped so far by a single Duskbringer cruiser. Take it out for us, and I might be grateful enough to reward you."</text>
