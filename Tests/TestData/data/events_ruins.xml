	<text planet="PLANET_MOONS">In front of you lays a massive monolith structure on the surface of a moon. The exterior is entirely black, with a few dim lights here and there. Maybe it holds something of value?</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_LAVA">A half cubical ship, split straight down the middle, has crash landed on the nearby lava planet. Though the conditions are hazardous, there might be something of worth remaining.</text>
	<text>Before you lies ruins unlike anything you've ever seen. Entirely black and cubical, the skeletons of a few massive warships remain at this beacon. Maybe you can salvage something here?</text>
	<text>A humongous cubical mega-structure lies in your wake, transmitting a short but undecipherable message. Surely if this thing still has enough power to send a message, maybe it has something worth taking?</text>
	<text>You appear to be witnessing the aftermath of a terribly damaged and brutally torn apart mega-class carrier ship, larger than your cruiser or even the Federation's largest fleet ships. Even stranger, the wreck is entirely black and cubical. Maybe it contains something worth salvaging?</text>
	<text>The remains of a couple strange looking Auto-ships, certainly not of Rebel design though similar in tech according to scans, are scattered around the remains of a massive cubical cruiser. Maybe there's more tech aboard the ship?</text>
	<text>The wreck of a dated and foreign vessel is being pelted by a small and thinly dispersed asteroid field. Though the asteroids have clearly caused some damage, the storm has mostly passed by, and won't be an issue for much longer. Maybe something of value is left behind?</text>
