	<text>Moments before the Leech ship is destroyed, the ship almost seems to halt, as if in the final moments they realized their failure and gave up in an instant. That depressing realization won't stop you from scrapping their ship however.</text>

	<text>Expecting the ship to be empty, you step aboard, only to see that one of the Leech crew is still alive! However, instead of fighting back, the Leech only curls up into a ball and bites hard into his own body, killing himself instantly. How morbid.</text>
	<text>Walking among the corpses of these parasites is nothing short of eerie. Their wide gaping mouths seem as if they could reach out at any moment and strike you. You keep your hand near your blaster at all times as you scrap the ship.</text>
	<text>Apparently, shortly after death, the corpse of a Leech will drain itself slowly of all the built up electricity it has stored over its life. With this many bodies, it could be catastrophic in close quarters. You make sure to hurry and scrap the ship before you can get caught in a mine field of electrified bodies.</text>

	<text>An image of a silent Lanius captain appears on your monitor. Images of their well-filled cargo hold follow. You come to the conclusion that they are trying to barter for a cease-fire.</text>
	<text>The Lanius ship hails you. Your translator struggles, spurting out "Prevent death... Merciful... Penitent...". You believe they are surrendering.</text>
	<text>You receive a hail from the ship followed by a crude translation device spurting, "Stop. Stop. Stop."</text>
	<text>You receive an image of their captain, silhouetted by the destruction aboard their ship. It bows forward with the metallic appendages about its body doing the same. It appears to be requesting mercy.</text>
	<text>Your comms system receives a video feed of the enemy ship's crew waving small makeshift white flags. It appears they have taken research about your culture's customs quite literally.</text>
	<text>You receive a message from the enemy ship that your translator struggles to interpret, "Penitence for metal. Offering intention."</text>
	<text>You receive a one word message from the enemy ship, "Surrender." You assume they are asking to surrender rather than demanding your surrender.</text>
