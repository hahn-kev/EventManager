Well, you have me now. I give up. Jusssst kill me."</text>

He turns his attention to Billy. "Now now Billster, your time is up. Vael's tired of your malarkey. You oughta know by now when you mess with men like him, you better keep your promises."

"Yes, yes, hello. I am Metyunt, the manager of this facility and caretaker of the Lizard demographic." Metyunt pushes the glasses back up onto his face, unfazed while a flaming stone is thrown nearby and some lizard rioters tear apart a Hektar ship in the background. You also notice a very large Slug ship hovering above the crowd. It's not firing yet, but you suspect if the crowd pushes thing too far, this is their plan to suppress it.</text>

They would still be living in squalor back on their Homeworlds, and inevitable victims of some crazy Zoltan politician who wants to deforest their planet to make room for a new law school or something."
