	<text>An advertisement appears on your screen as you approach, depicting a slim and well-kept Leech. "Hey there, I'm Mr. Senior. Tony Senior, that is! Owner of Tony's! I'd like to announce our brand new partnership with Hektar Industries! Come on and stop by!" You swear you've seen this ad before long ago. This definitely isn't "brand new", and "Tony's" is a massive retail chain. For some reason they're looping this same ancient ad, but that hardly matters.</text>
	<text>Looks like the nearby station is a "Tony's", one of the only Leech-owned as well as the largest retail chain in the Multiverse. Besides the usual commodities, these stores are infamous for selling military goods suspiciously labeled as "gardening appliances".</text>
	<text>Seems an advertisement from the local Tony's is playing over your intercom. Strange to find such a large retail chain offering military weapons, but considering they also sell second-hand organs and prostitutes, it's not that out of place.</text>
	<text>"Hey there folks! Come on in and stop by your local Tony's! We've got uh... um... come on and stop by!" Despite the unconvincing pitch, you've heard of these places. Owned by a mysterious and elusive Leech tycoon, "Tony's" serves as the Multiverse's largest retail chain, and for good reason.</text>
	<text>A Slug ship flies past but stops when they see you. Their captain half-heartedly hands you a flier advertising "great deals!" on Hektar-brand modular weaponry(tm) being sold at the nearby Tony's. The ship jumps away, but you figure the reputation of the Leech retail chain outcompetes the rudeness of the Slugs.</text>
	<text>A passive-aggressive jingle plays on the stereo, broadcasting from the nearby retail store. "Come on to Tony's! Come on to Tony's! YOU. WILL. SHOP."</text>
	<text>The bright colors and simple yet recognizeable logo of the nearby store brings back memories. The infamous brand of "Tony's" is known for a lot of things, some good, some bad, and some bizarre. A lot of strange myths are centered around its founder Tony Sr., from his involvement in the mafia to a dark past with Zulfiqar. You have no idea if any of these are true, but their stores are known for quality merchandise, and you figure it's worth a look.</text>

	<text>Despite the colorful isles and fascinating trinkets, there isn't much here to excite a mercenary captain like yourself. Though, if you ever need a battery powered tongue trimmer or a complete set of action figures from the hit Leech soap opera "Orfaces of Rilla," you suppose you know where to look.</text>
	<text>There isn't much in the store that interests you, disappointing considering all the tales you've heard of these places. A rather flirtatious Vampweed cashier attempts to get your number, but the bloodstains on her uniform warn you not to give her your time.</text>
	<text>Several alien species roam the stores alongside you, but no one makes any attempts to speak to one another. Not that you could if you wanted to, because the music playing over the intercom is so loud the items on the shelves are vibrating. It's better if you don't stick around in case you lose your hearing.</text>
	<text>A few ancient posters from a long-past Eargen election are still hung up outside. Considering no president has been democratically elected in the Republic for years, it's quite ironic, but a quick chat with the surprisingly friendly staff reveal that it's just become a joke among them. Besides that interaction, there isn't much reason to stick around.</text>
	<text>You stop by the station but don't find anything of interest on sale besides the military supplies. You take a quick detour to the store's bathroom, but the uncomfortable sloshing noises from inside convince you to stay away and just wait until you're back on the ship.</text>

Some 7 years ago some asshole Slugs screwed up my life and the only thing I've got to make up for it is showering myself in money. Vael seemed like an easy way out, and now I'm back to square zero. Or... hmmm. Look, maybe you can do me a favor. Just shoot me. Get it over with and spare me the trouble. Otherwise I'm going to have to explain to someone why I need them to throw me out an airlock."</text>

													<text>"My god... Rig? Is that you? How are you here?" You have no idea what's going on, but Tony explains. "7 years ago Tony's was nothing but a small chain local only to the Republic and quite small. I hoped to change that around by selling Zulfiqar goods. I met with Rig to discuss the terms when out of nowhere a Slug ship arrived and mind controlled me into sticking myself up Rig's... uh... asshole. The surgeons had no idea how to handle the situation. For 3 years we lived like that, stuck together. I was forced to eat Rig's waste to survive. Eventually we found a professional capable of separating us, but it was too late to save either of us from the permanent trauma."</text>
													<choice hidden="true">
														<text>Uh...</text>
														<event>
															<text>"That deal never did go through, by the way." Tony turns to Rig, who shrugs. When Rig explains his new situation to Tony, the Leech simply can't believe it. "You... you were mind controlled by the SAME Slugs? What!? There must be something deeper here... You know, I've spent a lot of time searching for the ones responsible, and I think I've found them. Maybe together we can finally track them down and get some sweet sweet revenge."</text>

<textList name="TEXT_HEKTAR_STORE">
    <text>Looks like a Hektar representative is orbiting a nearby marketplace, painted a gash shade of neon yellow which stands out from miles away. Hopefully whatever goods are inside aren't as obnoxiously vibrant.</text>
    <text>An overenthusiastic employee of Hektar greets you. "HEY! HI! HELLO! HOWDY! HOW DO YOU DO? PLEASSSE BUY THINGSSS! I CAN'T SSSSEE MY FAMILY AGAIN UNTIL I MEET MY QUOTA!"</text>
    <text>You arrive at the store, but the ship meant to greet you is deathly silent. After several subsequent hails the captain is startled awake. "Ah god damn it, you woke me up! Yeah yeah whatever, come sssshop or sssome ssshit."</text>
    <text>A loud advertisement blasts over your stereo, with an obese Slug waving his arms in the air and begging you to come and shop. Seems like unfortunate placement considering you're already here.</text>
    <text>These Hektar stores sure are plentiful. It's almost concerning how much of this sector is just stores, but you suppose it's better than deadly Rebels.</text>
    <text>A sleezy clerk with grease stains on his chest eyes your ship. "Eh, a Federation ship? You musssst have money! Gimme gimme!"</text>
