<textList name="TEXT_LIGHTSPEED">
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. Around you swirls distant stars and planets as they fly past at breakneck speed.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. The mild concern of smashing into a planet crosses your mind, but you figure some sort of security system is in place to prevent that. Hopefully.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. It's amazing to think long ago the idea of travelling between worlds in a matter of minutes to hours was nothing but a fantasy.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. You hope the light doesn't mind that you've showed them up.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. Old Earth scientists would be proud to know their research wasn't in vain.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. You can feel the gentle vibrations running down the ship. It would be relaxing, if it wasn't for the giant space rocks flying towards your ship at alarming speeds every few seconds.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. You make a quick trip to the engines to listen to the FTL drive hum away as it works.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. The journey to the next sector will hopefully be quick. The Rebel fleet might be fast, but they still can't follow you through hyperspeed.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. You catch a brief glimpse of what you think might be another ship in hyperspeed as well, but they quickly pass by.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. It must be an interesting life as a Civilian who never leaves their home planet. It's a tough choice sure, but the life of a traveller is one you'd never pass up.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. Your Multiverse drive is still charging. It can take months for it to be ready for the next reality jump, but your mission here isn't over yet anyways.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. Not to be confused with Multiverse travel, hyperspeed is merely the process of travelling from system to system, or sector to sector.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. While it can take mere minutes to travel between two beacons, it can take hours to travel between sectors. Fortunately this delay applies to all ships, including the Rebels.</text>
	<text>You've entered hyperspeed. Your journey to the next sector should hopefully remain uneventful. Dead-space, as it's called, is the territory between sectors, and is known to be mostly empty.</text>

	The Galactic Union is widely mocked for its name - don't be fooled. It's far from galactic, though its leaders would like to make you think it is. The Union is an alliance of many various previously independent corporate states. While primarily populated by humans, the Union has become the sanctuary for many alien refugees during recent times.</text>

	The Union Coreworlds are also home to Earth, the homeworlds of man-kind. Heavily protected by the Militia, this is no place to play villain, unless you're willing to suffer the consequences. Despite this, in recent times a mysterious pirate faction known as the Brood have begun terrorizing Union settlements abroad. Keep a look out for these elusive pirates - there might be a reward for taking them down.</text>
