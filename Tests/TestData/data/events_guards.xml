Apparently, even the Crystal Empire has begun sending "liberators" to the Theocracy, who have found an unexpected sanctuary among the Outcasts. Perhaps you could find the same luck here?</text>

	<text>This sector was bustling with activity just a few years ago. Now, more than half of the jump beacons have been destroyed, many settlements have been abandoned and the Rebels patrol constantly.</text>
	<text>This sector was hit hard by the rebellion. The many alien settlements and stations located here are now watched over by almost an equal number of Rebel bases, heavy-handedly 'keeping the peace'.</text>
	<text>Once the Federation forces were scattered, the Rebels came down hard on the locals here. Between the 'tax collectors' and military bases, the Rebel presence in this sector is high.</text>
	<text>At one point this was one of the most commonly travelled sectors. Knowing that, the Rebels have stationed a number of fleets here. Be careful.</text>
	<text>You will have to be very cautious in this sector. The Rebels have full control and are no doubt looking for you.</text>

	<text>Welcome to Vagabond space. Population? Hard to say - the Ghosts that live here live in disorganized clans, traveling between ships. They're rarely picky over their residency, but a ship like yours would look mighty fine to them...</text>
	<text>Tales between travelers often depict these sectors as haunted, riddled with the supernatural. In reality, it's just a bunch of unfortunately named gas beings known as the Ghosts. They certainly aren't spirits of the dead, but the Vagabonds hold no allegiance to anyone.</text>
	<text>Anywhere else, a pile of scrap makes a good bribe to keep most foes off your back. This isn't the case here. The Vagabonds could care less about scrap, they just want your ship. And that's something you aren't willing to give up.</text>

	<text>According to the database, it looks like the Rebels have dispatched numerous Auto-ships to these sectors as part of some weird war against the Dynasty. Hopefully you can stay out of the crossfires as much as necessary.</text>
	<text>The Dynasty isn't particuarly friendly to the Federation. They seem to have bunched them in along with the Rebels as 'bad men.' Maybe you can break this stereotype? Probably not, but one can dream...</text>
