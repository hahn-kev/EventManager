	<text>It looks quiet, but you realize your computer is being scanned. A hidden Rock vessel hails you: "Why do you fill your computer with lies?! These are not the holy words!" Before you can interject they open fire.</text>
	<text>You notice a Rock ship performing combat exercises. However, they quickly change their course to engage your ship. They apparently treat unregistered alien ships as handy target practice.</text>
	<text>A loud 'thud' resounds through the ship after jump completion - you've just shunted a Rock fighter and he's already preparing to fire!</text>

	<text>Your very presence in this sector is a tremendous insult to Rock-kind. The Rockmen in the nearby system aren't pleased with your presence and decide to deal with you themselves.</text>
	<text>Rockmen aren't particularly friendly, but you know you've made a real mistake coming here when the civilians near this beacon go out of their way to initiate combat with you.</text>

The Federation has since put an end to the Inquisition, but the Crusader rank has not yet been disbanded.

									<text>The Dread Pirate Tuco, true to what the Outcast claims, is not so much a singular person but rather a title. The original Tuco for which the moniker was derived lived during the days of the archaic Rock-Crystal Empire and fought against Toarde and the other 4 Rock Elders during the collapse of the Empire. While Tuco's side inevitably lost and the Theocracy rose from the ashes of that war, stories of the ventures of Tuco continued to be shared by Rock school-children even after the Elders forbade them from being told. Several Rockmen have picked up the title of Tuco since then, giving the name even more infamy and immortality. The current holder of the title is believed to once have been known as Rowbad, and currently works as a bodyguard for Ocym, the Aquarian co-founder of the Argeonn smuggler clan.</text>

Though they started peacefully, Stonewall (the residing Elder and leader of the Inquisitions) would not dare have anyone question himself or the other Elders, and so he dispatched his Crusader forces to handle the crowds."</text>

Soon, the conflict grew so large that the Paladins from Numa V had to be called, a rare but significant show of force from the Elders. So numerous were the arrests made that it was clear executions would be inefficient, and so the leaders of the protests were killed and the rest exiled. Tuco, with nowhere left to go, journeyed with the countless thousands of other Outcasts to the Badlands, where they founded the first of the Outcast settlements that we live in today."</text>

Tuco himself was one of the many victims of these raids, and so he was taken to the Tiiikaka camps. But Tuco cared not for chains and cuffs, and so at night he put together a resistance effort to defeat their cruel masters.

She was but a young child at the time, but what were we to do? The Rock people hated us, they saw us as exactly what we were. My daughter hated me too, and one day she simply vanished from her room in Toarde's palace along with her brother. Toarde was furious, and he blamed me because he had no one else to blame."</text>

The outcasts who lived here hated me, but I was able to survive by proving my usefulness as a guide through the unexplored halls of the buildings. I had helped in the planning for the original construction of Turban before it was abandoned, you see. After the outcasts had established full control I was allowed to stay, but they began to call me the 'cursed one.' A homeless prophet who wandered the streets claimed that I would bring destruction to this place. And... well, here we are I suppose."</text>

	<text>There is a palpable feeling of unease in the room, but every attempt to break the tension goes nowhere. Through the silence you can hear the distant thuds and feel the violent shaking as the bombardment of the city above continues without relent. At this rate, nothing will be left. Hours pass, and you're certain the fleet is making progress on your location. Several times footsteps can be heard outside the room, but no one ever enters.</text>

			<text>Argo begins to hum a tune, some old Rock folk-song, but he's interrupted by an announcement over an old radio in the corner of the room. "Attention all those who remain: return to the surface at once and surrender yourselves. Those who have taken refuge in the sewers or ravines will be quickly snuffed out." You remotely check your ship's radar and see a concerningly large new blip appear. Seems the Theocracy has deployed a cruiser vessel of some kind.</text>

					<text>It seems, despite the silence, that the room has unanimously decided to stand together. As the Theocracy search parties draw near, the door to the room is violently torn from its unstable hinges and you soon find your face on the floor with a gun to your head. Barely any sort of fight is put up as the Theocracy outnumbers your group by almost another 10 soldiers. You're drawn out to the surface, where you find the city is now little more than rubble.</text>

							<text>The Theocracy team transporting the group splits you and your crew off from the others, handing you over to the Coalition troops by the side. During the transfer however, Argo breaks free from his restraints and takes down one of the Crusaders. In the panic, your crew escape and make it back to your ship while the survivors draw arms and battle against the Theocracy ground troops. You trust them to hold their own this time, but they won't stand a chance unless you can take down that cruiser! Not like you have a choice, because it's already locked onto your vessel and is approaching fast.</text>

			<text>It seems the Theocracy's mission is complete, even if some survived. Most of the ships have jumped away, and visibly the survivors managed to scrape through the fire-fight. Among them is Argo, carrying a bloodied staff typically carried by priests such as he used to be. "I am in no way qualified to speak in such manners, but I think it goes without saying we people of Turban thank you. We Outcasts never expected the Federation to aid us in such a way. Assuming it has survived the bombardment, you should find a Rock cruiser on the landing pads outside of the city. It belongs to me, but I want you to have it. I must stay here and help repair the city. Turban will stand once again, I am certain of it."</text>
