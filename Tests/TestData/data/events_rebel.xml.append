	<text>By the time you notice the Rebel ship behind the beacon, it's too late to avoid a fight.</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship hails. "We did not fight a war to let a single Federation ship shatter our dreams of a better galaxy!" He locks weapons.</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship approaches cautiously. "Personally," says the captain, "I'd have stuck with the Federation. But I'm a soldier, sir, and I'm no use without a war to fight. Raise your shields!"</text>
	<text>You're hailed by a Rebel ship: "When the rebellion is complete you'll see the safer world we provide. Well, you won't, but you get the point." They arm weapons.</text>
	<text>You receive a hail from a Rebel fighter: "I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the-" you cut off the Rebel ship and prepare to fight.</text>

		<text>A suspicious amount of time passes without response from your crew. You're about to call them when a group of security guards come out onto the stage. Your heart drops when you see the bruised body of your crew member with them. They whisper something to the politician, who then says, "It appears this scum has attempted to take my life with a simple hand held laser! The Federation cannot see that a little gun will not stop the Rebellion!" The guards drop your crew onto the floor, and the politician swiftly draws an old Earth revolver and shoots them three times in the head. You quickly hurry out of the stadium before they can catch any more of you.</text>

With all the chaos you've caused, the Rebels are going to need to spend a lot of time on damage control. You doubt the Fleet will be concerned with following you for a while.</text>

All of you Federation soldiers, you share your experiences with the Rebellion.

It seems he's been a high priority target for a while, but for some reason the Federation troops sent after him never succeed. Tuffy laughs at something, and the other two join in. You're left out of the joke, but with all the alcohol in your body you hardly notice or care.</text>

You think you hear something about Jerry being the best man at Tuffy's wedding, but that doesn't make much sense. You think.</text>
