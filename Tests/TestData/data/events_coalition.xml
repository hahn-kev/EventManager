			<text>You push forward, exploring empty hallway after empty hallway, barren room after barren room. Laboratories filled with shelves that are empty, even hangars with nothing but a few scattered trollies. There's no signs of a struggle nor any bodies, so you can only make one assumption. This place was built in preparation of something, some plan that hasn't yet come to fruition. But what could it be?</text>

				<text>There must be something here - keep looking!</text>

					<text>You do another once-over of the facility, searching for any clues. It takes some time, but eventually you come across a secret compartment that leads deeper underground. The security systems look unfinished, so the Coalition must have been relying on the secrecy of this location as protection for the time being.</text>

						<text>Look inside.</text>

							<text>The secret room reveals itself to be some kind of meeting room. 4 ornate chairs face encircle a large holotable - one for the leader of all 4 factions within the Coalition. A door behind the table leads into a huge cathedral-like space. There's so many things to look through, but first you head over to the most obvious. An unfinished frame and blueprints for a prototype Coalition cruiser - something to compete with the Federation and Rebellion's own advanced warships. You make scans of the blueprints then set fire to them. This should set the Coalition back a bit, though they probably have copies.</text>

								<text>Take a look at the rest of the room.</text>
								<event>
									<text>The rest of the room is filled with ruins of some ancient technology made from Aether, similar to that of the vessel the first Multiverse drive was reverse engineered from. On the table are papers with partial translations of the alien hieroglyphics, detailing strange and worrying descriptions of "doomsday bombs," "reality altering monoliths," and a drawing of a cubical robot with a single eye. You heard the Coalition recovered some precursor tech during the Aquarian invasions, but you had no idea their research was this in-depth. You don't have time to bring all of this back to the ship, but you grab one of the seemingly functional weapons to bring with you.</text>
