	<text>A Mantis military scout hails your ship. "Foolish alien! You has stifled greatness for too long! You rue the day you back the Federation!"</text>
	<text>A small Mantis cruiser is broadcasting a repeating message on a wide-band frequency, "Non-Mantis ship that enter territory are forfeit. Lower shields and surrender if value your lives."</text>
	<text>You detect a small military outpost and a few freighters nearby. This mineral rich planet in an isolated location would be perfect for an illegal Mantis mining operation. As you consider your options, a ship launches from the outpost. Prepare for a fight.</text>
	<text>You discover yet another unlicensed and uncharted Mantis colony. They certainly waste no time expanding their claims. A Mantis ship moves to intercept you before you can jump away.</text>
	<text>A Mantis military scout seems to have just finished a salvage op on a nearby wreck. They have no time to waste with warnings and appear to wish to fight.</text>

	<text>A nearby Mantis ship begins aggressive maneuvers. You prepare for the worst.</text>
	<text>A stream of clicks and gurgling comes on the comm from a hostile Mantis scout. The universal translator might be on the blink, but his intent is obvious.</text>
	<text>The Mantis ship is pleased to see you, and fires up its weapon systems.</text>
	<text>You recognize the outline of a Mantis ship against the blackness. Engage!</text>
	<text>Something red looms. It's the Mantis.</text>
	<text>A Mantis vessel hails you. "Hail is merely distraction!" You notice their shields and weapons have come online.</text>
	<text>You notice a flurry of laser fire glance by the port window. The Mantis are upon you.</text>
	<text>The Mantis hail you. Their captain says, "I claim vessel for my clan. Good hunting!"</text>
	<text>A Mantis female comes on the vidscreen. The females don't make it to authority unless they're particularly vicious. You power the weapons.</text>
	<text>A Mantis ship with the markings of a warrior tribe breaks position and attacks!</text>
	<text>A Mantis ship hails: "Ah! Fine prey. Fine prey! We honor with most eviscerating arsenal!" You sense a cloud to this silver lining and power the weapons.</text>
	<text>Children on Earth are told terrible tales of the blood red Mantis invasion ships - much like the one bearing down on you now - which once threatened the planet. You order weapons free!</text>
	<text>A youthful-looking Mantis captain hails. "You, prey, must know. Your death, Kaaazthwak's final kill before maturity. Kaaazthwak pay respects." Seems respects in Mantis culture are paid with lasers.</text>

	<text>This is it- the Mantis Hive. No wonder it's so hard to find, as the bulk of the city is located in a massive cavern underground.

							<text>You're ceremoniously 'welcomed' into the palace, and with some brief fanfare Leikonpliiinakra emerges, dressed in golden robes. By the way you see Kazaaak looking at her, she must be quite desirable for a Mantis. She pays little attention to you or Lai, instead flirting with the Mantis warrior by your side. After some exchanged formalities, she walks back into the palace and you are ushered to follow.</text>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>Follow.</text>
								<event>
									<text>The next location you find yourself in is a long dining hall, its tables decorated in Mantis cuisine. At last, Leikonpliiinakra speaks to your group as a whole, and strangely well spoken for a Mantis at that. "As soon as I heard my darling Kaz had returned, I knew you would come here. Sit, and feast as much as you like. We will discuss whatever business you have come here for after."</text>
									<choice hidden="true">

											<text>You spend most of the feast in awkward silence, with only occasional conversation between Kazaaak and Leik. Eventually, things turn more serious. "I am not oblivious to Kaz's recent movements in Coalition space, but I have chosen to turn a blind eye to them. I can only expect that you have come here to negotiate the Hive's withdrawal from the alliance."</text>
											<choice hidden="true">
												<text>Yes.</text>
												<event>
													<text>"Then I'm afraid that I both cannot do such a thing nor would it have any impact. Even if I were to withdraw from the Coalition, which frankly is an idea I would not entirely be opposed to, you would have to convince the Leikonpliiinakra of every reality to withdraw as well. You might not realize it, but the Coalition has secured many realities of its own. But regardless of this, the Hive is not in a position to cut ties with the Coalition. After the Federation-Mantis War our economy has been in ruin, and the industrial might of the Kleptocracy and Theocracy have aided us greatly."</text>
													<choice hidden="true">
														<text>Oh...</text>
														<event>
															<text>With that conclusion made, Leik turns back to Kazaaak. "My apologies dear, but in your absence the Hive has not grown fond of you. But traveling in-arms with another traitor to the Episcopacy and a Federation Captain has not helped your image. I love you, but my role as queen means I must place the safety of the Hive first. It is clear where your line in the sand has been drawn, so this must mark the end of us. And I'm afraid there is another reason I have allowed you here. The capture of the fugitive you have brought with you, Laiiikarkapi. I apologize my dear, for it was my fault appointing you to this role. But such things cannot go unpunished. This is the last stop for all of you. I can at least promise you your funerals will be held with honor." Leikonpliiinakra stands up, and her guards draw their weapons. You hurry out of the palace just in time to witness a massive cruiser approaching to stop you! Seems it's time to fight your way out of here.</text>
