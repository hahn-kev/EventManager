	<text>Despite the unfriendly attitude from many of the inhabitants of the sector, it appears you've happened across a trader who doesn't care about who his client is - as long as they have scrap to spend.</text>
	<text>It appears not all Crystals are unwilling to deal with outsiders. A merchant vessel nearby opens communications and requests to trade.</text>
	<text>You receive a hail from a Crystalline vessel. "Outsiders? Look at your tiny ship... Haha!" You roll your eyes and prepare to leave when they hail you again. "Wait, wait, don't leave. This was merely me trying to set up a trade!"</text>
	<text>A Rock station drifts nearby, with several other ships docked outside. Their captain greets you and welcomes you aboard to shop.</text>

	<text>A few small ships are visible on the vidscreen, and you almost activate weapons targeting. However, sensors indicate they are simply honest merchants. The pirates must be making you jumpy. You message them asking about their wares.</text>
	<text>You detect a hub of activity nearby. A large corporation has set up a trade depot and has a number of well armed ships patrolling. This appears to be a relatively safe place to get repairs.</text>
	<text>You receive a wide-band automated message, "Welcome to our humble trade depot and shipyard! All are welcome, but try any funny business and our 152 automated turret satellites will tear your ship to shreds!"</text>

	<text>The only thing within scanning range is an old abandoned mining structure and a resupply station. They appear to have been picked clean by marauders.</text>
	<text>You arrive to have a small fleet of Engi ships target you with a message, "Piracy results in negative societal impact. Not permitted." You assure them of your honest intentions and they allow you to pass.</text>

	<text>You come across a Rock trading post. It's rare they deal with outsiders, but they need to sell the last of their stock, and will pay their dues for their transgression when they return home.</text>	
	<text>With the local Rock settlements so unwilling to trade with other life forms, an opportunistic Mantis crew has postponed its piracy activities and set up shop to catch any passing trade.</text>
	<text>The Rock tolerate few aliens in their space, but even they seem to respect the wisdom of the Zoltan - a few of them have established a trading post in the husk of an abandoned capital ship.</text>
	<text>You receive a hail on Federation frequencies: "You're Federation?! We- we weren't sure we'd ever see a friendly face again. There's little business here, perhaps you'd like to trade?"</text>

	<text>You arrive and detect signs of battle. A few ships are taking passes at each other near a small station. You don't know if it's a territory issue, a contest or a rite of passage but you decide it's best to stay out of it.</text>
	<text>There's not much at this beacon. Just a few abandoned depots, stripped clean.</text>
	<text>A few freighters pass by but they refuse all communications. Must not want to sully their reputation by talking with foreigners.</text>
	<text>You see a small trading post and ask about refuelling but they respond, "Go away! We don't serve your kind here."</text>
	<text>You see a Zoltan merchant and ask about his wares. He responds, "Sorry, but it took years to gain their trust. I can't be seen communicating with you. I hope you understand." He cuts communications.</text>

	<text>It seems a small Rock trading station is operating here. Surprisingly, it claims to be open to ships of all sorts, regardless of their origins.</text>

	<text>It's a miracle to find an empty beacon here, one free from the brutal enforcers who patrol this sector and the ever hostile citizens.</text>
	<text>You can't remember many tales of the Rock Inquisition from Universe 0, but you're sure just a horribly violent war had terrible causalities on the Rock population. This beacon is unnervingly empty of all life, and you can only wonder if it is a consequence of the warmongering of the Elders' pre-Federation years.</text>
	<text>A Rock patrol orbits around the beacon, but luckily they seem rather laid back. They hail you, "we won't tell if you don't either."</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED">A Rock settlement lays far in the distance, but they refuse to respond to any hails. This beacon may as well be empty, because nothing can counter the stubbornness of the Rockmen.</text>

	<text>You are surprised to see a Rebel ship stranded in this space. Rather than attacking, they offer to trade with you.</text>
	<text>You find a black market being run at this beacon. Knowing the Coalition, they probably don't mind the opperation. Hopefully they wont mind you shopping here either.</text>
	<text>The Coalition has been bad for trade in this sector. However, you find a few traders who seem to be doing well despite the war.</text>
	<text>A large market is set up here. You avoid the few Coalition patrols around the area and get to the market undisturbed.</text>

I half expect a pirate to come barrelling down on us any second, or a Lanius to come along and melt us. We're trying to offload some inventory - interested in buying something?"</text>

	<text>Despite this sector being primarily abandoned, every now and then travelling merchants will use this sector in their path to the destination. One such ship is passing through and offers to trade.</text>

	<!--<text>You question a local settlement and they describe a fleet of metal ships wordlessly collecting all of the abandoned metal and debris in the area. When they approached important satellites, the settlements fired a few ASB warning shots. The Lanius moved on despite clearly having the firepower to overwhelm the settlements.</text>-->
	<!--<text>A few refugee ships are preparing for the long journey to another sector. They explain how a number of Lanius military ships surrounded them and began to hack their FTL drives. Fortunately the Lanius moved on after briefly scanning the civilian ships, leaving them more than a little shaken up.</text>-->

There was some cult rambling about the spreading of the disease, Humanitis. They forcefully boarded our ship and tried to open all of our airlocks, shouting, "Be purged!" Is nowhere safe anymore?"</text>-->
	
	<text>This beacon is void of Lanius, Ghosts, pirates, or any other ship for that matter.</text>
	<text>The charred remains of a civilian settlement suggests either recent pirate activity or a long ago battle with presumably Rebel forces. Either way, the beacon is now empty.</text>
